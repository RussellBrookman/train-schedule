# train-schedule 

This site is for the backend user. Values can be plugged into the server. It will then modify the values and automaticly change what is shown to the public with very little work needed to be done by the user. I used Firebase for the real time server. Firebase is connected through an Aplication Program Interface. (API) MomentJS is used to tell what time it is and is used to calculate the next arival of a train. This site also uses jQuery to help abbreviate JavaScript functions and Bootstrap is to modify the CSS to make the site a little better looking with ease.
